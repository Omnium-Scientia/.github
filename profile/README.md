## Welcome to the Omnium Scientia project

This project as for goal to present a full Software Engineering course. 

### Targets 

Course's goal is to allow people to be better at software engineering, 
either self-taught people in search of knowledge, 
software engineering students or professionals who want to learn more. 

### How to take this course

This course is composed of multiple courses,
you can either follow all of them,
or you can either cherry-pick some of them. 

If you want to follow all of them: see the [course ordering chart](../doc/course_ordering_chart.svg) 
to see what the advised path of learning is. 

If you want to cherry-pick some of the courses, see the syllabus of each course to see the prerequisites of it.

### Disponibles courses 

Actually, the available courses are: see [OVERVIEW.md](../doc/OVERVIEW.md).

### Courses release 

Since the courses of this project are meant to be evolving, adding more knowledge and clarity, we want to make releases 
that follows the beginning of academic years. 

Our target is to make two releases each year: 
- one around January 
- one around June/July 

This is because some countries (France, USA, ...) begin their academic year in August/September, and some others (Japan, 
Brazil, ...) begin in February/March. 

Other releases could happen as we finish a massive improvement (new semester of lecture, ...).
