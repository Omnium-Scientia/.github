Hi, if you are reading this, it is because consider contributing to this project. 
To do that, open an issue corresponding to the change you want to make or contribute to an existing issue. 

There are multiple ways to contribute: 
- Solve spelling or grammar errors
- Solve a correctness error
- Propose a change in an explanation to clarify it 
- Propose new material in a course (e.g., new chapter, new example ...)

Those ways to contribute are ordered from the amount of explanation needed for your merge request to be accepted. 

### Solve spelling or grammar errors

We do not need an insane amount of explanation here, maybe one or two sentences that explain to what extends this is a mistake. 

### Solve a correctness error 

We need more, basically aside from your correction, we need an explanation of the error and your possible sources. 

### Propose a change in an explanation to clarify it 

We will need a fairly detailed explanation of why this gives a better grasp of the concept than the previous explanation. 

### Propose a new material in a course 

We will need an explanation about: 
- why is it a good idea to add this material?
- why did you place this material here (in terms of chapter numbering etc.)?
- why does not this break the coherence of the course?
